<h1 id="moved_xh">Moved_XH</h1>
<p>Moved_XH facilitates to cater to pages which have been renamed. Direkt links to those pages will normally result in a 404 Page Not Found error, but Moved_XH makes it possible to redirect incoming requests to another page or to flag them as gone. Appropriate information is returned that informs bots about the change, what is particularly important regarding search engines, which can change the URL of the page and remove it from the index respectively.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<p>Moved_XH is a plugin for <a href="https://www.cmsimple-xh.org/">CMSimple_XH</a>. It requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.7.0, and PHP ≥ 7.1.0.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/cmb69/moved_xh/releases/latest">lastest release</a> is available for download on Github.</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/?for-users/working-with-the-cms/plugins#id3_install-plugin">CMSimple_XH Wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory <code>moved/</code> to your server into the <code>plugins/</code> directory of CMSimple_XH.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subfolders <code>css/</code> and <code>languages/</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate to <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Moved</code> to check if all requirements are fulfilled.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>The configuration of the plugin is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in the back-end of the Website. Select <code>Plugins</code> → <code>Moved</code>.</p>
<p>Localization is done under <code>Language</code>. You can translate the character strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<p>The look of Moved_XH can be customized under <code>Stylesheet</code>.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Moved_XH stores its data separately for each language of the CMSimple_XH installation in a file <code>moved.csv</code> in the respective <code>content/</code> folder. Incoming requests to pages that do not exist and have no rule in <code>moved.csv</code> are logged in the log file of CMSimple_XH. The description of the log entry contains the requested page and the referrer, if known.</p>
<p>The rules can be edited in the plugin administration under <code>Main Settings</code>. Each line of the file constitutes a rule. Rules consist of one or two so called <em>page URL</em>s. Technically speaking, a <em>page URL</em> is the name of the first parameter of the query string, i.e. everything between the question mark (<code>?</code>) and the first ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) resp. the end of the URL, if there is no ampersand. It is recommended to copy the <em>page URL</em>s from the address bar of the browser instead of entering them manually, because there will be some surprises. For instance, the <em>page URL</em> of the fictious page <a href="https://www.example.com/?Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen">Fahrvergnügen</a> is <code>Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen</code> and not <code>Fahrvergnügen</code> as one might expect.</p>
<p>There are two different types of rules:</p>
<h3 id="redirects">Redirects</h3>
<p>Redirect rules will redirect incoming requests for an old <em>page URL</em> to a new <em>page URL</em> or an external URL (which has to be fully qualified, i.e. starting with the protocol, e.g. <code>https://</code>). Both URLs are seperated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>).</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<p>You are restructuring your site and want to move the toplevel page <em>Oaks</em> to the second level below <em>Trees</em>, so add the following rule:</p>
<pre><code>Oaks=Trees/Oaks</code></pre>
<p>You have moved the page <em>Oaks</em> to another CMSimple_XH installation, so add the following rule:</p>
<pre><code>Oaks=https://www.example.com/trees/?Oaks</code></pre>
<p>You have upgraded from an <em>ISO-8859-1</em> encoded CMSimple version to a <em>UTF-8</em> encoded CMSimple_XH installation, and you have a page <em>Fahrvergnügen</em>, so add the following rule:</p>
<pre><code>Fahrverg%FCgen=Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen</code></pre>
<h3 id="gone">Gone</h3>
<p>Gone rules will inform visitors that a page does no longer exists. They consist of the <em>page URL</em> of the removed page.</p>
<p>For example, if you have removed the page <em>Temporary Information</em> because it is no longer needed, so add the following rule:</p>
<pre><code>Temporary_Information</code></pre>
<h3 id="placeholders">Placeholders</h3>
<p>The old <em>page URL</em> of the rules may contain placeholders, where a <code>*</code> matches an arbitrary amount of characters and <code>?</code> matches a single character. Only the first matching rule will ever be used; others will simply be ignored for the request. Placeholders do not offer any new features, but are rather meant to avoid repetitions of similar rules. For example:</p>
<p>You have removed the pages <em>Temporary Information 1</em> and <em>Temporary Information 2</em>, because they are no longer needed, so you could add the following rules:</p>
<pre><code>Temporary_Information_1
Temporary_Information_2</code></pre>
<p>By using placeholders, you can simplify, though:</p>
<pre><code>Temporary_Information_?</code></pre>
<p>It is also possible to use whatever has been matched by a placeholder in the new <em>Page URL</em> of a redirect rule (i.e. on the right hand side of the equal sign). This is done with variables of the form <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code> … <code>$9</code>, where <code>$1</code> matches the first placeholder, <code>$2</code> the second, and so forth.</p>
<p>For example, you are restructuring your site and want to move the toplevel page <em>Oaks</em> to the second level below <em>Trees</em>, where <em>Oaks</em> already has three subpages. You could add the following rules:</p>
<pre><code>Oaks:White_Oak=Trees:Oaks:White_Oak
Oaks:Blackjack_Oak=Trees:Oaks:Blackjack_Oak
Oaks:Blue_Oak=Trees:Oaks:Blue_Oak</code></pre>
<p>By using a placeholder, you can simplify, though:</p>
<pre><code>Oaks:*=Trees:Oaks:$1</code></pre>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Moved_XH uses the <a href="https://wiki.cmsimple-xh.org/?tips-and-tricks/custom-404-page&amp;search=custom+404"><code>custom_404()</code> hook</a>, so it does not work if the hook is alread defined. In this case you will get a blank browser window when you browse to your website. Either uninstall Moved_XH or remove the existing <code>custom_404()</code> hook.</p>
<p>Moved_XH’s rules do not work when you are logged in to the CMSimple_XH installation, as the <code>custom_404()</code> hook funktion is not called by CMSimple_XH in this case. If you want to test the rules without logging out, you have to use a second browser.</p>
