<h1>Moved_XH&mdash;a CMSimple_XH Plugin</h1>
<img src="../moved.png" alt="Plugin Icon" style="float:left; margin-right: 1em">
<p style="text-align:justify">Moved_XH facilitates to cater for pages which have
been renamed. Direkt links to those pages will normally result in a 404 Page Not
Found error, but Moved_XH makes it possible to redirect incoming requests to
another page or to flag them as gone. Appropriate information is returned that
informs bots about the change, what is particularly important regarding search
engines, which can change the URL of the page resp. remove it from the
index.</p>

<h2><a name="notice">Important Notice</a></h2>
<p><strong>Moved_XH couldn't be tested so far in various environments. It is a
so called BETA version. Use with caution!</strong></p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>
        Moved_XH requires CMSimple_XH ≥ 1.6.3 and PHP ≥ 5.4.0.
</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>
<p>The installation is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins. See the <a
href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/installation">CMSimple_XH
wiki</a> for further details.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Backup the data on your server.</strong></li>
<li>Unzip the distribution on your computer.</li>
<li>Upload the whole directory moved/ to your server into CMSimple_XH's plugins
directory.</li>
<li>Set write permissions to the subdirectory languages/ and the
plugin's content folders (/content/moved/).</li>

</ol>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="settings">Settings</a></h2>
<p>The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
the website's back-end. Select "Moved" from "Plugins".</p>
<!--<p>You can change the default settings of Moved_XH in "Config". Hints for
the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
mouse.</p>
--><p>Localization is done in "Language". You can translate the character
strings to your own language, or customize them according to your needs.</p>
<div class="toplink"><a href="#">back to top</a></div>

<h2><a name="usage">Usage</a></h2>
<p>Moved_XH stores its data separately for each language resp. subsite of the
CMSimple_XH installation in a subfolder moved/ of the respective content/ folder.
The rules regarding the renamed pages are stored in data.csv; incoming requests
to pages that do not exist and do not have a rule in data.csv are logged in the
log file of CMSimple_XH. The log entry's description contains the requested page
and the referrer, if known.
</p>
<p>The rules can be edited in the plugin administration under "Main Settings".
Each line of the file constitutes a rule. Rules consist of one resp. two so
called page URLs. Technically speaking, a page URL is the name of the first
parameter of the query string, i.e. everything between the question mark (?) and
the first ampersand (&amp;) resp. the end of the URL, if there's no ampersand.
It is recommended to copy the page URLs from the address bar of the browser
instead of entering them manually, because there'll be some surprises. For
instance, the page URL of the fictious page <a
href="http://www.example.com/?Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen">Fahrvergn&uuml;gen</a> is
Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen and not Fahrvergn&uuml;gen as one might expect.</p>
<p>There are two different types of rules:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Redirects</dt>
    <dd><p>Redirect rules will redirect incoming requests for an old page URL to
    a new page URL or an external URL (which has to be fully qualified, i.e.
    starting with the protocol, e.g. http://). Both URLs are seperated by
    an equal sign (=).</p>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>You are restructuring your site and want to move the toplevel page "Oaks"
    to the second level below "Trees", so add the following rule:</p>
    <pre>Oaks=Trees:Oaks</pre>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>You have moved the page "Oaks" to another CMSimple_XH installation, so
    add the following rule:</p>
    <pre>Oaks=http://www.example.com/trees/?Oaks</pre>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>You have upgraded from an ISO-8859-1 encoded CMSimple version to a
    UTF-8 encoded CMSimple_XH installation, and you have a page
    "Fahrvergn&uuml;gen", so add the following rule:</p>
    <pre>Fahrverg%FCgen=Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen</pre>
    </dd>
    <dt>Gone</dt>
    <dd><p>Gone rules will inform visitors that a page does not exists anymore.
    They consist of the page URL of the removed page.</p>
    <h5>Example</h5>
    <p>You have removed the page "Temporary Information" because it is no more
    needed, so add the following rule:</p>
    <pre>Temporary_Information</pre>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="limitations">Limitations</a></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Moved_XH uses the <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/tips_and_tricks#custom_404_error_page">custom_404()
    hook</a>, so it doesn't work if the hook is alread defined. In this case
    you'll get a blank browser window when you browse to your website. Either
    uninstall Moved_XH or remove the existing custom_404() hook.</li>
    <li>Moved_XH's rules don't work when you're logged in to the CMSimple_XH
    installation, as the custom_404() hook funktion is not called by CMSimple_XH
    in this case. If you want to test the rules without logging out, you have to
    use a second browser.</li>
