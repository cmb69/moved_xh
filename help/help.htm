<p>
    Moved_XH facilitates to cater to pages which have been renamed. Direkt links
    to those pages will normally result in a 404 Page Not Found error, but
    Moved_XH makes it possible to redirect incoming requests to another page or
    to flag them as gone. Appropriate information is returned that informs bots
    about the change, what is particularly important regarding search engines,
    which can change the URL of the page resp. remove it from the index.

</li>
<li class="important">

    fulfilled.
</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section id="settings">
<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
    The plugin's configuration is done as with many other CMSimple_XH plugins in
    the website's back-end. Select <i>Plugins</i> → <i>Moved</i>.
</p>
<!--
<p>
    You can change the default settings of Moved_XH under <i>Config</i>. Hints
    for the options will be displayed when hovering over the help icon with your
    mouse.
</p>
-->
<p>
    Localization is done under <i>Language</i>. You can translate the character
    strings to your own language if there is no appropriate language file available,
    or customize them according to your needs.
</p>
<p>
    The look of Moved_XH can be customized under <i>Stylesheet</i>.
</p>
</section>

<section id="usage">
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
    Moved_XH stores its data separately for each language of the CMSimple_XH
    installation in a file <code>moved.csv</code> in the respective
    <code>content/</code> folder. Incoming requests to pages that do not exist
    and do not have a rule in <code>moved.csv</code> are logged in the log file
    of CMSimple_XH. The log entry's description contains the requested page and
    the referrer, if known.
</p>
<p>
    The rules can be edited in the plugin administration under <i>Main
    Settings</i>. Each line of the file constitutes a rule. Rules consist of one
    resp. two so called <i>page URL</i>s. Technically speaking, a <i>page
    URL</i> is the name of the first parameter of the query string, i.e.
    everything between the question mark (<code>?</code>) and the first
    ampersand (<code>&amp;</code>) resp. the end of the URL, if there's no
    ampersand. It is recommended to copy the <i>page URL</i>s from the address
    bar of the browser instead of entering them manually, because there'll be
    some surprises. For instance, the <i>page URL</i> of the fictious page <a
    href="http://www.example.com/?Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen">Fahrvergn&uuml;gen</a> is
    <code>Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen</code> and not <code>Fahrvergnügen</code> as one
    might expect.
</p>
<p>There are two different types of rules:</p>

<section id="usage-redirects">
<h3>Redirects</h3>
<p>
    Redirect rules will redirect incoming requests for an old <i>page URL</i> to
    a new <i>page URL</i> or an external URL (which has to be fully qualified,
    i.e. starting with the protocol, e.g. <code>http://</code>). Both URLs are
    seperated by an equal sign (<code>=</code>).
</p>
<h4>Example #1</h4>
<p>
    You are restructuring your site and want to move the toplevel page
    "Oaks" to the second level below "Trees", so add the following rule:
</p>
<pre>Oaks=Trees:Oaks</pre>
<h4>Example #2</h4>
<p>
    You have moved the page "Oaks" to another CMSimple_XH installation,
    so add the following rule:
</p>
<pre>Oaks=http://www.example.com/trees/?Oaks</pre>
<h4>Example #3</h4>
<p>
    You have upgraded from an <i>ISO-8859-1</i> encoded CMSimple version
    to a <i>UTF-8</i> encoded CMSimple_XH installation, and you have a
    page "Fahrvergn&uuml;gen", so add the following rule:
</p>
<pre>Fahrverg%FCgen=Fahrvergn%C3%BCgen</pre>
</section>

<section id="usage-gone">
<h3>Gone</h3>
<p>
    Gone rules will inform visitors that a page does not exists anymore.
    They consist of the <i>page URL</i> of the removed page.
</p>
<h4>Example #4</h4>
<p>
    You have removed the page "Temporary Information" because it is no
    more needed, so add the following rule:
</p>
<pre>Temporary_Information</pre>
</section>

<section id="usage_placeholders">
<h3>Placeholders</h3>
<p>
    The old <i>page URL</i> of the rules may contain placeholders, where a
    <code>*</code> matches an arbitrary amount of characters and <code>?</code>
    matches a single character.  Only the first matching rule will ever be used;
    others will simply be ignored for the request.  Placeholder do not offer any
    new features, but are rather meant to avoid repetitions of similar rules.
</p>
<h4>Example #5</h4>
<p>
    You have removed the pages "Temporary Information 1" and "Temporary Information 2", because they are no
    more needed, so you could add the following rules:
</p>
<pre>
Temporary_Information_1
Temporary_Information_2
</pre>
<p>
    By using placeholders, you can simplify, though:
</p>
<pre>Temporary_Information_?</pre>
<p>
    It is also possible to use whatever has been matched by a placeholder in the
    new <i>Page URL</i> of a redirect rule (i.e. on the right hand side of the
    equal sign).  This is done with variables of the form <code>$1</code>,
    <code>$2</code> … <code>$9</code>, where <code>$1</code> matches the first
    placeholder, <code>$2</code> the second, and so forth.
</p>
<section>
<h4>Example #6</h4>
<p>
    You are restructuring your site and want to move the toplevel page "Oaks" to
    the second level below "Trees", where "Oaks" already has three subpages. You
    could add the following rules:
</p>
<pre>
Oaks:White_Oak=Trees:Oaks:White_Oak
Oaks:Blackjack_Oak=Trees:Oaks:Blackjack_Oak
Oaks:Blue_Oak=Trees:Oaks:Blue_Oak
</pre>
<p>
    By using a placeholder, you can simplify, though:
</p>
<pre>Oaks:*=Trees:Oaks:$1</pre>

<section id="limitations">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
    Moved_XH uses the <a
    href="http://www.cmsimple-xh.org/wiki/doku.php/tips_and_tricks#custom_404_error_page"><code>custom_404()
    hook</code></a>, so it doesn't work if the hook is alread defined. In this
    case you'll get a blank browser window when you browse to your website.
    Either uninstall Moved_XH or remove the existing <code>custom_404()</code>
    hook.
</p>
<p>
    Moved_XH's rules don't work when you're logged in to the CMSimple_XH
    installation, as the <code>custom_404()</code> hook funktion is not called
    by CMSimple_XH in this case. If you want to test the rules without logging
    out, you have to use a second browser.
